        <span class="blue"><b>Who We Are</b></span> <br>

        <br>

        We are a group of volunteers who has chosen to give one night each month 

        to make life a bit pleasanter for twelve homeless men and women.<br>

        We are the whole range of New Yorkers, young, old, and in-between. We 

        are artists, actors and musicians, students, teachers and social workers, 

        stock brokers and investment bankers, lawyers and judges. Some of us are 

        Quakers; many of us are not. What we have in common is the wish to help 

        in a direct and positive way.

      <p> <a name="what"></a><br>

        <span class="blue"><b>What We Do</b></span> <br>

        <br>

        We provide shelter and hospitality for twelve homeless people at the Friends 

        Meeting House in Manhattan. The shelter is open seven days a week, every 

        day of the year. All of our homeless guests are referred to us by the 

        Neighborhood Coalition for Homeless People, a drop-in center on the Upper 

        East Side. The Neighborhood Coalition provides many services including 

        screening our guests for drugs, alcohol and tuberculosis. Two of our volunteers 

        arrive at 8:00pm to set up the cots and a refreshment table. Our guests 

        arrive by bus from the drop-in center at around 8:30pm. Lights are out 

        at 10pm. Wake up time is at 6, when we set out a light breakfast. The 

        bus comes to pick up our guests at a little before 7, giving us time to 

        store the cots, tidy up and leave in time to go to work or to whatever 

        we do in our daily lives.

      <br>

      <p><a name="training"></a><br>

        <span class="blue"><b>Training</b></span> <br><br>

        All of our volunteers participate in a simple training that lasts about 

        90 minutes. The on-site training is not an education in social work, but 

        a hands-on tour of the facilities: e.g. Where is the peanut butter? We 

        set out the beds and food, talk about the nightly routine, mention briefly 

        the Quaker philosophy of the equality and dignity of all people, and greet 

        the guests when the bus arrives. We encourage our new trainees to sign 

        up for their first night at the shelter, which is always with an experienced 

        volunteer.<br>

        <span class="blue"><b>History</b></span> <br>

        <br>

        Late in 1982, a small group of Quakers, concerned about the growing problem 

        of homelessness in New York City, began to discuss a way to provide shelter 

        to homeless people. Fifteenth Street Meeting of the Society of Friends 

        approved a plan and our shelter opened in April 1983. Churches and synagogues 

        all over the city were devising their own ways of contributing, and a 

        network under the auspices of the city and in contract with the Partnership 

        for the Homeless was started. We are part of that network. Our shelter 

        has continued growing so we now shelter twelve people and we open every 

        night of the year, every night that we have two volunteers willing to 

        come and sleep with us.

        The Friends Shelter is located at 15 Rutherford Place in New York City. 

        Rutherford Place, between Second and Third Avenue is a short two-block 

        street that runs from 15th Street to 17th Street. To get there, take a 

        subway to Union Square and walk three blocks east to Rutherford Place. 

        15 Rutherford Place is not only home to the shelter but to many Quaker 

        groups and institutions, including Friends Seminary, a well-known private 

        K &#8211;12 school, the 15th Street Monthly Meeting and the American Friends 

        Service Committee. (<a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&addtohistory=&address=15%2Brutherford%2Bplace&city=ny&state=ny&zipcode=10014&homesubmit=Get%2BMap">map</a>)
